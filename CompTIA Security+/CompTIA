Fundamentals of Security
----------------------------------

Information Security - Act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful modification and disruption, disclosure, and corruption, and destruction.

Information Systems Security - Act of protecting the systems that hold and process the critica data.

Confidentiality - Ensures that information is only accessible to those with the appropriate authorization.

Integrity - Ensures that data is accurate and unaltered unless modification is required.

Availability - Ensures that information and resources are accessible and functional when needed by authorized users.

Non-repudiation - Guaranteeing that a specific action or event has taken place and cannot be denied by the parties involved.

AAA of Security
-> Authentitication - Process of verifying the identity or a user or system.

-> Authorization - Defines what actions or resources a user can access.

-> Accounting - Act of tracking user activities and resource usage, typically for audit or billing purposes.

Security Controls - Measures or mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information sysyems and date.
-> Technical

-> Managerial

-> Operational

-> Physical

Zero Trust - Security model that operates on the principle that no one, whether insite or outside the organization, shoul be trusted by default.
-> Control Plane - Consists of the adaptive identity, thread scope reduction, policy-driven access control and secured zones.

-> Data Plane - Focused on the subject/system, policy engine, policy administrator and establishing policy enforcement points.

Threads and Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------

Thread - Anything that could cause harm, loss, damage or compromise to information technology systems.

Types of threads
-> Natural disasters

-> Cyber-attacks

-> Data integrity breaches

-> Disclosure of confidential information

Vulnerability - Any weakness in the system design or implementation.

Types of vulnerabilities
-> Software bugs

-> Misconfigured software

-> Impoperly proteted network devices

-> Missing security patches

-> Lack of physical security

Risk Management - Finding different ways to minimize the likelihood of an outcome occuring and achieve the desired outcomes.

Confidentiality
-------------------------

Confidentiality - Refers to the protection of information from unauthorized access and disclosure.

Confdentiality is important for three main reasons
-> Protect personal privacy

-> Maintain a business advantage

-> Achieve regulatory compliance
->> PII
->> PHI
->> Various types of financial data

 5 basic methods are used to ensure confidentiality
 -> Encryption - Process of converting data into code to prevent unauthorized access.
 
 -> Access Controls - Ensures only authorized personnel can access certain types of data.
 
 -> Data Masking - Method that involves obscuring data within a database to make it inaccessible for unauthorized users while retaining the real data's authenticity and use for authorized users.
 
 -> Physical Security Measures - Used to ensure confidentiality for physical types of data and for digital information contained on servers and workstations.
 
 -> Training and Awareness - Conducting regular training on the security awareness best practices that employees can use to protect the organization's sensitive data.

Integrity
---------

Integrity - Helps to ensure information and data remain accurate and unchanged from their original state unless intentionally modified by an authorized individual.

Integrity is important for three main reasons
-> Ensure Data Accuracy

-> Maintain Trust

-> Ensure System Operability

Methods used to maintain integrity
-> Hashing - Process of converting data into a fixed-size value
* Hish Digest = Digital fingerprint

-> Digital Signatures - Use encryption to ensure integrity and authenticity

-> Checksums - Method to verify the integrity of data during transmission

-> Access Controls - Ensure that only authorized individuals can modify data and reduce the risk of unintentional or malicious alteration.

-> Regular Audits - Involve reviewing logs and operations to ensure that only authorized changes have been made and any discrepancies are addressed.

Availability
------------

Availability - Used to ensure that information, systems and resources are accessible and operational when needed by authorized users.

-> Ensures Business Continuity

-> Maintains Customer Trust

-> Upholds an Organization's Reputation

Redundancy -> Duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of enhancing its reliability.

Types of redundancy
-> Server Redundancy - Involves using multiple servers in a load balance so that if one is overloaded or fails, the other server can take over the load to continue supporting end users.

-> Data Redundancy - Involves storing data in multiple places.

-> Network Redundancy - Ensures that if one network path fails, the data can travel through another route.

-> Power Redundancy - Involves using backup power sources to ensure that an organization's systems remain operational during periods of power disruption or outages within a local service area.

Non-repudiation
---------------

Non-repudiation - Focused on providing undeniable proof in digital transactions.

Digital Signiture - Created by first hashing a particular message or communication to be digitally signed and encrypting the hash digest with the user's private key using asymmetric encryption.

Non-repudiation is important for:
-> Confirming the Authenticity of Digital Transactions

-> Ensuring Integrity

-> Providing Accountability

Authentication
--------------

Authentication - Security measure that ensures individuals or entities are who they claim to be during a communication or transaction.

Authentication methods
-> Something you know - Relies on information that a user can recall.

-> Something you have - Relies on the user presenting a physical item to authenticare themselves.

-> Something you are - Relies on the user providing a unique physical or behavioral characteristic of the person to validate that they are who they claim to be.

-> Something you do - Relies on the user conducting a unique action to prove who they are.

-> Somewhere you are - Relies on the user being in a certain geographic location before access is granted.

Two-factor Authentication (2FA)

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) - Two or more auth methods

Authentication:
-> Prevents unauthorized access
-> Protect user data and privacy
-> Ensure resource validity

Authorization
-------------

Authorization - Permissions and privileges granted to users or entities after they have been authenticated.

Users with access to a system determine the actions they can perform, the data they can view or modify and the areas they can access.

Authorization mechanisms range from role-based to rule-based to attribute-based controls to determini permissions.

Authorization
-> Protects sensitive data
-> Maintain system integrity in organizations
-> Create more streamlined user experiences

* -> Set of rules and policies that are used to dictate what actions users can perform once verified. 
* -> Serves as the gatekeeper to ensure that the right people have access for the right things.

Accounting
----------

Accounting - Security measure that ensures all user activities are properly tracked and recorded.

-> Transparency
-> Security
-> Accountability

Tracks:
-> Logging into the system
-> Accessing the files
-> Modifying configuration settings
-> Downloading or intalling software
-> Attempting unauthorized actions on systems and networks

->> Audit Trail - Provides a chronological record of all user activities that can be used to trace changes, unauthorized access or anomalies back to a specific user or point in time.

->> Regulatory Compliance - Maintains a comprehensive record of all the users' activities.

->> Forensic Analysis - Uses detailed accounting and event logs that can help cybersecurity experts understand what happened, how it happened and how to prevent similar incidents from occuring again in the future.

->> Resource Optimization - Organizations can optimize system performance and minimize costs by tracking resource utilization and allocation decisions.

->> User Accountability - Thorough accounting system ensures users' actions are monitored and logged, deterring potential misuse and promoting adherence to the organization's policies.

Technologies used to perform accouting:
-> Syslog severs - Used to aggregate logs from various network devices and systems so that system administrators can analyze them to detect patterns or anomalies in the organization's system.

-> Network analysis tools - Used to capture and analyze network traffic to gain detailed insight into all the data moving within a network.

-> SIEMs = Security Information and Event Management - Provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by verious hardware and software infrastructures in an organization.

Security Controls Categories
----------------------------

Technical Controls - The technologies, hardware and software mechanisms that are implemented to manage and reduce risks.
->> Firewalls
->> Encryption Processes
->> Intrusion Detection Systems

Managerial Controls - Involve the strategic planning and governance side of security.
->> Beyond risk assessments, managerial controls also encompass security policies, training programs and incident response strategies.

Operational Controls - Procedures and measures that are designed to protect data on a day-to-day basis and are mainly governed by internal processes and human actions.
->> Backup Procedures
->> Account Reviews
->> User Training Programs

Physical Controls - Tangible, real-world measures taken to protect assets.
->> Shredding of sensitive documents
->> Security guards
->> Locking the doors

Security is about appreciating the multifaceted layers of protection that come together to form a robust security posture.

Security Control Types
----------------------

-> Preventative Controls - Proactive measures implemented to thwart potential security threats or breaches

-> Deterrent Controls - Aim to discourage potential attackers by making the effort seem less appealing or more challenging.

-> Detective Controls - Monitor and alert organizations to malicious activities as they occur or shortly thereafter.
* IDS

-> Corrective Controls - Mitigate any potential damage and restore the system to their normal state.

-> Compensating Controls - Alternative measures that are implemented when primary security controls are not feasible or effective.

-> Directive Controls - Often rooted in policy or documentation and set the standards for behavior within an organization.
